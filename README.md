# Transcribro

Transcribro is a private and on-device speech recognition keyboard and service for Android.\
It uses whisper.cpp to run the OpenAI Whisper family of models and Silero VAD for voice activity detection.\
It features a voice input keyboard, enabling you to type with speech.\
It can also be used by other apps either explicitly or when set as the user-selected speech to text app which some apps
may use for speech to text.

## Branding

You may not use the name "Transcribro", a name that includes "Transcribro", and the app icon in a derivative work that
has published builds.\
This is to prevent confusion of which is the official Transcribro.
